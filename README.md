# MWS Project 1 - Accessible and Responsive Web Apps

## Goal of the Project

Build a Restaurant Reviews App that meets accessibility standards and provides a responsive user experience. In this first stage, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility, and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Add a service worker to begin converting to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.

The original starter code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1)
